			<h1>Welcome to the NDEx Prototype Site</h1>

				<p>This site provides a preview of the functionality of NDEx, the Network Data Exchange</p>

				<p>NDEx will be an open-source, web-based software system to enable individuals, groups, and 
				software applications to share, store, manipulate, and publish biological network knowledge. </p>

		<h2>Store and share networks</h2>
			<p>NDEx is like Google Docs for scientists working with biological networks!</p>
			<p>Each user can upload networks to their account, then share with collaborators or with the public</p>
			<p>Click <a href="/my-account">here</a> to see an example of a user home page</p>

		<h2>NDEx supports networks in multiple formats</h2>
			<p>including OpenBEL, SBML, BioPAX, and PSI-MI. </p> 
			<p>Because full semantic interoperability between existing network formats is an open issue, 
			the project will instead create task-specific format translation services.</p>

		<h2>Organizations appear as NDEx groups</h2>
			<p>Click <a href="/groups/pathwaycommons">here</a> to see an example of an organization home page</p>

		<h2>Networks can be visualized</h2>

		<h2>Groups also enable informal collaborations</h2>
			<p>Click <a href="/groups/e2fworkinggroup">here</a> to see an example of a collaboration page</p>

		<h2>Users can search for networks</h2>
			<p>Click <a href="/my-account">here</a> to see an example of network search results</p>

		<h2>Networks can be compared</h2>

			<p> 
			The Network Database Project applies ideas from social networking and collaboration systems 
			to create a novel information commons in which users and groups interact by sharing networks. 
			Users control which groups and users have access to each network. 
			Groups may represent organizations or they can be created for specific projects or collaborations.

			Networks are downloaded by users or manipulated and visualized in place using web-based tools. Cytoscape users access the site via an App, allowing the use of the broad range of Cytoscape tools to analyze and transform networks. A web API enables custom analytic applications to access and manipulate networks.

			Beyond sharing, the system addresses the issue of publication of stable versions of networks. Networks can be explicitly created as dated versions including publication meta-data. Published versions are immutable and are assigned stable URIs and DOIs, making the networks and their contents suitable for reference by publications, by other networks, and by analytic applications.

			The public release of the Network Database Project is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2013. We invite scientists and organizations - academic, non-profit, and commercial - to share and publish networks as users of this system.
